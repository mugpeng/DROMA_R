\title{Generate comprehensive statistical plots from DROMA database projects}
\usage{
generateStatisticalPlots(
  projects = "all",
  plot_types = "all",
  data_type = "all",
  connection = NULL,
  use_gap_plots = TRUE,
  reverse_molecular = FALSE,
  only_overlapping = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{projects}{Character vector of project names to include. Use "all" to include all projects from database}

\item{plot_types}{Character vector of plot types to generate: "counts", "overlaps",
"molecular", "drug_moa", "tumor_types", or "all"}

\item{data_type}{Character, filter by data type: "all" (default), "CellLine", "PDO", "PDC", or "PDX"}

\item{connection}{Optional database connection object. If NULL, uses global connection}

\item{use_gap_plots}{Logical, whether to use gap plots for large count differences}

\item{reverse_molecular}{Logical, whether to reverse axes in molecular characteristics plot. Default FALSE}

\item{only_overlapping}{Logical, whether to only show samples/drugs that appear in multiple projects and filter out projects with no overlapping samples/drugs in overlap plots. Default FALSE}
}
\value{
List of ggplot objects with statistical plots
}
\description{
Creates statistical overview plots showing drug/sample counts, overlaps,
molecular characteristics, and tumor type distributions from projects in the DROMA database
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Connect to database
con <- connectDROMADatabase("path/to/droma.sqlite")

# Generate plots for all projects
stat_plots <- generateStatisticalPlots("all", plot_types = "all")

# Generate plots for specific projects
stat_plots <- generateStatisticalPlots(c("gCSI", "CCLE"), plot_types = "counts")

# Generate plots for cell line projects only
stat_plots <- generateStatisticalPlots("all", data_type = "CellLine")

# Generate plots with reversed molecular plot
stat_plots <- generateStatisticalPlots("all", reverse_molecular = TRUE)

# Generate overlap plots with only overlapping samples/drugs
stat_plots <- generateStatisticalPlots("all", plot_types = "overlaps", only_overlapping = TRUE)
}
