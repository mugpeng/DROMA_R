\title{Get intersection of significant features across multiple analyses}
\usage{
getIntersectSignificantFeatures(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{Named data frames from getSignificantFeatures(), or a named list of such data frames.
Names will be used as suffixes for columns (e.g., effect_size_drug1, effect_size_drug2)}
}
\value{
Data frame with intersecting features and their statistics from each analysis (columns suffixed by input names)
}
\description{
Identifies features that are significant across multiple meta-analysis results and merges their statistics
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Get significant features for two drugs
sig_drug1 <- getSignificantFeatures(meta_df1)
sig_drug2 <- getSignificantFeatures(meta_df2)

# Find common significant features (using named arguments)
common <- getIntersectSignificantFeatures(drug1 = sig_drug1, drug2 = sig_drug2)

# Or using a named list
sig_list <- list(Paclitaxel = sig_drug1, Gemcitabine = sig_drug2, Cisplatin = sig_drug3)
common <- getIntersectSignificantFeatures(sig_list)
}
}
