Description: DROMA (Drug Omics Association) provides tools for analyzing associations 
    between drug responses and various omics data types. It supports meta-analysis 
    of drug-omics associations across multiple datasets, visualization of results, 
    and batch processing of features. The package enables researchers to identify 
    and validate biomarkers for drug sensitivity across multiple data sources.
